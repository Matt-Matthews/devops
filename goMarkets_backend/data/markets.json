      "The Pure Boland Market is a monthly food and goods market held at the \u201cGroenstoor\u201d in picturesque Brandwacht, just outside Worcester.  This popular event showcases the local produce and delicious homemade food of small businesses in the Breede River Valley area. ",
      "Every first Saturday of the month, the Groenstoor in Brandwacht, serves as the home of Pure Boland Market.

The market only takes place on the first Saturday of each month from 9am-3pm (except for January). \u00a0\u00a0The Pure Boland Market at the \u201cGroenstoor\u201d became a monthly favourite among locals and since 2009 when it first opened its doors.\u00a0 Now people come from all parts of the Western Cape to enjoy the local produce and delicious homemade food at this monthly market.It also became a hotspot for tourists visiting the area and many tourists plan their trip to the Breede Valley area around the market dates.",
      "A new Pop up Market concept evolved towards the end of 2022, after many wine cellars and other venues in the Boland started contacting the organiser, Tharina Marais, to host once off markets at their venues.\u00a0 Pure Boland Market has collaborated with a number of venues in the Breede Valley area to host pop up markets and will soon be expanding over the mountain towards Paarl and Cape Town as well.",
      "During Covid market products could be purchased from a temporary online shop to be delivered to your door.\u00a0 By customer demand, this will be reopening soon.\u00a0 Keep an eye on their social media for updates.",
